# Code Maker and Breaker Challenge

This quiz was given to us in class to essentially test us on what we have learned thus far. We were responsible for creating two simple forms via HTML: Breaker and Maker. We were given links with new information within them about the UTF-16 encoding text for encoding and decoding. We were to use that method to create an array of numbers out of the word 'hello!' and then vice versa.
